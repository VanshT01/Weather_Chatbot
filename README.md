# Weather Bot with FastAPI

This project is a simple and powerful weather bot built using **FastAPI**. The bot integrates **Azure Text Analytics** to extract city names from natural language queries and retrieves real-time weather data for those cities using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## Features:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Extracts city names from user queries (e.g., "What's the weather in New York?") using Azure AI.
- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Fetches current weather information, including temperature and conditions, using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Provides a scalable and easy-to-use API for weather queries.
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid cities and server errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- FastAPI
- Azure AI (Text Analytics)
- OpenWeatherMap API
